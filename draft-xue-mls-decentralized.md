--- abstract

The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides continuous key agreement,
and offers additional benefits in multi-device, a.k.a. group use cases. MLS
is reliant on a Delivery Service (DS) for message ordering. In highly
centralized uses, where the DS is a single server, configuration is
straightforward. However, MLS also lends itself to use cases that are
decentralized (e.g., federated networks) and even distributed (e.g., mesh
networks). This informational document lays out uses of MLS and its variants
and extensions across various topologies and provides guidance on selection
among alternatives under both functionality and security considerations.

# Introduction

While the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol had initial uses in the
construct of simple secure messaging deployments, developments on use cases
have extended into decentralized and distributed environments. This includes
decentralized uses such as federation, under the MIMI working group [cite]
and distributed uses such as across mesh networks. In such cases,
identification of an adequate delivery service (DS) to fit various topologies
and ensure precise commit ordering can be difficult, and the DS can incur
significant overhead in itself. This has driven consideration of how to
account for potential forking of the group state [cite] for re-ordered commit
messages or avoid the risk of out-of-order commits altogether [cite]. This
informational document provides an outline of uses of MLS and its extensions
across various network topology considerations, with specific considerations
to network overhead, storage, and security from state forking.


# Definitions

Members:       Protocol participants.
Centralized:   A centralized network has a single server or entity perform
               the responsibilites of a DS. An entity may also be a member.
Decentralized: A decentralized network relies on federation of servers or
               select entites performing the responsibilities of a DS. For
               example, assigned members may coordinate DS responsibilites
               among themselves.
Distributed:   A distributed network relies on many entities performing
               the responsibilities of a DS. This may include cases of
               many members or even all members participating in DS
               responsibilities, such as in mesh networks.


# Trade-off Considerations

## MLS
The MLS protocol is defined in [RFC9420].

### Overhead
MLS offers logarthimic overhead for groups.

Additional overhead from the DS must also be accounted for.

### Delivery Service
The centralized case is straightforward in MLS. For decentralized use cases
and distributed use cases, care must be taken to identify a suitable DS to
ensure that there is group consensus on commit ordering. As a use case
increases in complexity to the decentralized setting and thence to the
distributed setting, DS design decisions have increasing implications on
overhead and potentially also security.

In a decentralized setting, one example solution is to assign one server
(among a set of federated servers) as the decision holder for such ordering,
thereby creating a pseudo-centralized environment out of a decentralized
environment. In a distributed use case, the challenge increases. Similar
temporary role assignment to members, where in one is dedicated as a the
"lead" entity for deciding commit ordering may be possible in well-connected
use cases.

Another approach is hierarchical ordering of commits, e.g., where each
member is assigned an order in which to commit a PCS update. This eases the
complexity of the DS, but can create considerations on length of PCS windows,
especially if a member is offline. Handling of Adds and Removes must also be
accounted for.

Yet a further approach is that of using a consensus algorithm to reach
agreement on commit ordering. This offloads overhead to the DS as such
consensus algorithms can vary wideline in incurred overhead and delay for
processing, especially if a member is unreachable.

Thus maintaining consensus on commit ordering tends to incur increasing DS
overhead has network topology spreads.

### Resiliency

MLS is heavily dependent on commit ordering being processed in the correct
sequence. Out-of-order commits can lead to forks in the group state.


## DeMLS
In MLS, retention of a group state after applying a commit is strongly
discouraged, because it compromises the protocol's forward secrecy. As such,
clients can't process out-of-order commits, because the group state is deleted
after the first commit is applied.

DeMLS (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kohbrok-mls-dmls/) is a variant of
MLS that achieves fork resilience as introduced by Alwen et al.
(https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/394), which significantly improves forward secrecy
when retaining a group state after applying a commit.

The main difference between MLS and DeMLS is how the `init_secret` is derived in
the key schedule. Instead of a regular KDF, DeMLS uses a puncturable
pseudorandom function (PPRF), which prevents the client from deriving the same
`init_secret` twice, thus achieving forward secrecy for each specific commit.

### Overhead
As DeMLS is largely the same as MLS, it retains its performance characteristics
with the exception of local storage. Here, the PPRF used by DeMLS incurs a local
storage overhead on the order of 10 kB (depending slightly on the PPRF
implementation) per commit processed (if the old group state is retained). The
only other place where DeMLS differs from MLS is that an extra 32B epoch
identifier needs to be attached to every message to identify the exact group
state required to process the message.

### Delivery Service
Its fork resilience makes DeMLS generally suitable for use in environments where
the DS can't prevent the ocurrence of out-of-order commits.

However, due to the overhead associated with commit processing, DeMLS benefits
from a DS that can inform clients when out-of-order processing may be necessary.

For example, in federated environments, individual servers can detect when they
lose connectivity with other parts of the network and inform clients that they
may need to process multiple commits for the current epoch. Similarly, the
server can inform its clients when a given netsplit is over and old group states
can be deleted.

### Resiliency
DeMLS makes it safer to maintain multiple forks of a group at the added cost of
storage, as well as a slight complexity increase in MLS's key schedule. This
makes the use of MLS viable in environments where forks may occur due to
out-of-order commits.

## DiMLS
DiMLS is defined in draft-xue-distributed-mls-02
(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-xue-distributed-mls/)

DiMLS accomodates concurrent actions by
* defining a subset of group operations that are commutative and can be applied
ou of order
* using MLS groups as a primitive to represent each local snapshot of the
total group state
* advancing group state by distributing commits to the sender's local state
* maintaining causal dependency across MLS groups by exporting shared secrets and
importing them as PSK's.

### Overhead
DiMLS overhead has linear update overhead. However, it is not dependent on the
DS for commit ordering, reducing the DS overhead requirements. For example, a
consensus on commit ordering is not required for the DS unlike in MLS. Thus
the trade-off in DiMLS is among overhead incurred by the security protocol
itself and its architectural requirements in DS overhead.

### Delivery Service
In DiMLS there are fewer requirements on the DS for exact ordering. Members
must eventually receive each commit from each other member, but delivery does
not need to be ordered for members to maintain consistent state.


### Resiliency
DeMLS is highly resilient to out-of-order commits and, in the case of honest
members, forking of the group state is not possible. This is because each
member has full control of commit ordering as it relates to the keying state
protecting the messages that member sends.


# Use Cases
The basic MLS protocol functions well in environments where reliable in-order
delivery can be assured. That includes both centralized environment as well as
those in decentralized and distributed uses where the DS overhead for e.g.,
consensus is deemed supportable.

For cases of minor network topology spread, e.g., decentralized uses such as
federated servers, DeMLS can provide improvements to fork resiliency at minor
costs to storage.

For distributed environments where significant changes in network topologies are
expected, e.g., mesh networks, or where memory storage is a consideration,
DiMLS offers advantages.


# Security Considerations

This document covers security considerations for various applications of other

reference for use of MLS in decentralized or distributed environments, but
focuses on the issue of state forking in such use cases.
